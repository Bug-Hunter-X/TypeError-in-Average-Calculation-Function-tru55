This repository contains a Python code example that demonstrates a common TypeError when calculating the average of a list containing both numbers and strings. The bug.py file contains the buggy code, while the bugSolution.py file provides a corrected version that handles the error gracefully.  The error occurs because Python's sum() function cannot handle non-numeric values. The solution involves adding a type check to filter out non-numeric elements.
